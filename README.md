It is unofficial implementation of some experiments in this book. This repository mainly focus on four topics, including:

1 - Dimensionality Reduction and Transforms

* Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
* Fourier and Wavelet
* Sparsity and Compressed Sensing

2 - Machine Learning and Data Analysis

3 - Dynamics and Control

4 - Reduced Order Models
